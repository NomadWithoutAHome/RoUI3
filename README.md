Create beautiful animations for your Roblox GUIs with RoUI3, a user-friendly and feature-rich Roblox Studio plugin.

The successor to RoUI2, this plugin is foundationally the same yet contains a surplus of new features, a reworked codebase, and a completely overhauled look.

## Timeline Overview

RoUI3's primary plugin widget is known as the Timeline. The Timeline allows you to animate your GUIs quickly and exactly the way you want.
